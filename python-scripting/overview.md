## Success Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Start Small**: Begin with simple, single-purpose scripts
2. **Practice Regularly**: Write code daily, even small snippets
3. **Read Code**: Study well-written Python projects
4. **Test Everything**: Write tests for your scripts
5. **Document Well**: Comment your code and write documentation

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Writing monolithic scripts without functions
- Ignoring error handling and edge cases
- Not using version control from the beginning
- Hardcoding values instead of using configuration
- Skipping testing and code review processes
