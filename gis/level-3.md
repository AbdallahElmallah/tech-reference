## Problem It Solves
Level 3 focuses on understanding how spatial data is structured and organized for different applications. You'll learn to explore existing data models, understand their purpose, and apply them effectively in real-world scenarios.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Understanding Data Models

#### What is a Data Model?
A data model defines how spatial data is structured, organized, and related to represent real-world phenomena. It includes:
- **Entity definitions**: What features are represented
- **Attribute specifications**: What properties are stored
- **Relationships**: How features connect to each other
- **Constraints**: Rules that data must follow

#### Types of Spatial Data Models

**Vector Data Models**
- **Simple Feature Model**: Points, lines, polygons with attributes
- **Topological Model**: Features with explicit spatial relationships
- **Network Model**: Connected linear features (roads, utilities)
- **Object-Oriented Model**: Complex features with behaviors

**Raster Data Models**
- **Grid Model**: Regular cells with values
- **Image Model**: Pixels representing visual information
- **Surface Model**: Continuous phenomena (elevation, temperature)
- **Categorical Model**: Discrete classes (land use, soil types)

### 2. Common Application Data Models

#### Cadastral Data Model
**Purpose**: Land ownership and property boundaries

**Key Components**:
